# Woop

Welcome to Woop

Here your objective is to get past all the enemies and defeat the boss. You will have to go through sections of the map to find key cards that unlock doors. Keep an eye out for your weapon as it has the tendency to sometimes heal enemies instead of damaging them. If the weapon gives a green aura, it will heal the enemies. 

Tip: All hazards are not dangerous.



How to build: Clone the main branch, open in unity. Go to file, select build, hit build, set different path for build folder
